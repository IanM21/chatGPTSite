          <p>
            Today was an alright day. I wokeup to my alarm around 8:00 am EST and got out of bed to make myself a bowl of cereal for breakfast<br>
            I then went to brush my teeth and get dressed with a fire outfit (Mastermind Japan Knitted Sweater, White Dickies and Jordan 4 Military Blacks).<br>
            Then went to school for a few hours. I had Object Orientated Programming aswell as Intro to Full Stack Development<br>
            Once i returned home, I played a few games on my Xbox and made myself dinner which consisted of homemade burgers, sweet potato fries and potato salad.<br>
            </p>
          <p>Since then I have been completeing a few bits of work for week 1 of my second semester in college<br> and messing around with ChatGPT which gave me the idea to create this blog!</p>

          <p>You may not believe me when I say this, unless you have used <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat/" target="_blank">OpenAI's ChatGPT</a>, but this whole website was created using it.<br>
              However, at some points I had to use the knowledge I have with HTML/CSS/JS to make sure everything is how I want it to be and working fine.<br>
              P.S check out "Game Time?" if you're bored of reading this nonsense :)
